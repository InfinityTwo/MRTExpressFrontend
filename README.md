# MRT Express

The goal of this project is to min max the door entry and exit when you take the train from point A to point B. You can choose the exits, and choose whether you want to take the escalators, stairs or lifts, and it will magically give you the best route to take and the appropriate doors to board.

The frontend of MRT Express is this page. For the backend, please visit https://github.com/thortol/MRT-Express
